<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>It is time to make some variations of the game possible. What if you want to play with a friend and not with AI? What if you get tired of playing the game and want to see a match between two AI's? Finally, you need to be able to choose between being the first move or the second move when playing against AI.</p>

<p>Write a menu loop that can interpret two commands, "start" and "exit".</p>

<p>The command "start" should take two parameters: who will play X's and who will play O's. Two parameters are possible for now: "user" to play as a human and "easy" to play as an easy level AI. In the next stages, you will add "medium" and "hard".</p>

<p>The command "exit" should terminate the program.</p>

<p>Do not forget to handle incorrect input!</p>

<p>The example below shows how your program should work.</p>
